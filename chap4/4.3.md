# 4.3 Java中线程与同步机制的实现

Once again, it's time to look inside the JVM. This section covers some of the issues
implementing threads and synchronization in a Java runtime. The aim is to provide
enough insight and technical background so that the reader will be better equipped
to handle parallel constructs and understand how to use synchronization without
too much performance loss.

## 4.3.1 Java内存模型

On modern CPU architectures, data caches exist, which is a necessary mechanism
for speeding up data access for loads and stores and for reducing contention on the
processor bus. As with any cache mechanism, invalidation issues are a problem,
especially on multiprocessor systems where we often get the situation that two
processors want to access the same memory at the same time.

A memory model defines the circumstances under which different CPUs will and
won't see the same data. Memory models can be strong (x86 is fairly strong), where
multiple CPUs almost automatically see the same, newly stored, data after one of
them does a write to memory. In strong memory models, multiple writes to memory
locations as good as always occur in the same order as they were placed in the
code. Memory models can also be weak (such as IA-64), where there is virtually no
guarantee (unless the CPU writing the data executes a special barrier instruction)
when field accesses and, more generally, all Java induced memory accesses should
be visible to all.

Subtle differences handling read-after-write, write-after-read and write-after-
write dependencies of the same data exist on different hardware platforms. Java,
being a hardware agnostic language, needs to define strict semantics for how these
dependencies should be interpreted for threads in the JVM. This is a complication
not present in a static language like C++ that compiles to hardware specific code
and lacks a memory model per se. Although there is a  volatile keyword in C++ as
well as in Java, parts of the C++ program behavior are still impossible to decouple
from that of the hardware architecture for which it is compiled. Parts of the "de facto"
memory model in a C++ program also reside outside the language itself—in thread
libraries and in the semantics of operating system calls. On architectures with weak
memory models such as Intel IA-64, the programmer may even have to explicitly put
calls to memory barrier functions in the C++ program. Anyway, once compiled, the
behavior of the native code generated from the C++ will remain the same within the
chosen architecture.

But how can the programmer make sure that the same behavior applies to a
compiled Java program, no matter if it is running on x86, Itanium, PowerPC,
or SPARC? There are no explicit memory barriers in Java, and probably shouldn't
be either, because of its platform independence.
