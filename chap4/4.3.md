## 4.3.1 Java内存模型

现在CPU架构中，普遍使用了数据缓存机制，可以大幅提升CPU对数据的读写速度，降低处理器总线的竞争程度。正如所有的缓存系统一样，这里也存在一致性问题，对于多处理器系统来说尤其重要，因为多个处理器有可能同时访问内存中同一位置的数据。

内存模型定义了不同的CPU在同时访问内存中同一位置是，何种情况下会看到相同的值，何种情况下会看到不同的值。强内存模型（例如x86平台上，就相当强）是指，当某个CPU修改了某个内存位置的值后，其他的CPU几乎自动就可以看到这个刚刚保存的值，在这种内存模型之下，内存写操作的执行顺序与代码中的排列顺序相同。弱内存模型（例如IA-64平台）是指，当某个CPU修改了某个内存位置的值后，其他的CPU不一定可以看到这个刚刚保存的值（除非CPU在执行写操作时附有特殊的内存屏障类指令），从更一般的角度说，所有由Java程序引起的内存访问都应该堆其他所有CPU可见，但事实上却不能保证一定立即可见。

不同硬件平台上对于"读-写" "写-读" "写-写"操作的处理有细微区别。Java为了屏蔽硬件区别，因此定义了JVM对这些操作的具体处理方式。对于像C++这样会编译为平台相关代码，而且缺少内存模型的的静态编程语言来说，在对操作读写时就会比较痛苦，需要仔细考虑不同平台之间的区别。尽管C++中也有`volatile`关键字，但应用程序的具体行为还无法独立于其所在的系统平台。此外，在C++中，部分"事实上的"内存模型并不属于编程语言自身，而是由线程库和操作系统调用决定的。在像Intel IA-64这种具有弱内粗模型的CPU架构上，程序员有时甚至会在代码中显式使用内存屏障。 总之，C++源代码在某个系统平台上完成编译，应用程序的行为也就不会再发生改变了。

Java是如何保证在所有支持的平台上具有相同的行为呢？在Java编程语言中并不存在内存屏障这东西，而且考虑到Java所追求的平台无关性，或许就不应该有内存屏障。

### 4.3.1.1 早期内存模型中的问题

之所以Java中需要有一个统一的内存模型，是为了保证在不同的硬件平台上能够有一致的行为。从Java的1.0版本到1.4版本，在实现内存模型的时候都是按照原始的Java语言规范做的。但是，第一版的Java内存模型中存在着严重的问题，实际使用时，会导致无法达到预期效果，而且有时还会使编译器的优化失效。

原始内存模型允许编译器对操作`volatile`变量和非`volatile`变量重新排序。以下面的代码为例：

    volatile int x;
    int y;
    volatile boolean finished;
    
    /* Code executed by Thread 1 */
    x = 17;
    y = 4711;
    finished = true;
    /* Thread 1 goes to sleep here */
    
    /* Code executed by Thread 2 */
    if (finished) {
        System.err.println(x):
        System.err.println(y);
    }

In the old memory model, the previous code was guaranteed to print out 17 , but not
necessarily  4711 , once Thread 2 was woken up. This had to do with the semantics
for  volatile . They were clearly defined, but not in relation to non-volatile reads or
writes. To a person used to working closer to hardware than a Java programmer, this
might not be too surprising, but often Java programmers intuitively expected that
constructs like the assignment to  finished shown earlier would act as a barrier, and
commit all earlier field stores to memory, including the non-volatile ones. The new
memory model has enforced stricter barrier behavior for  volatile , also with respect
to non-volatile fields.

按照旧版的内存模型，上面的代码会打印出`17`，但未必会打印`4711`，这与`volatitle`关键字的语义有关。虽然`volatitle`关键字有明确的定义，但对非`volatitle`变量的读写操作却没有明确的定义。

Recollect from our "infinite loop" example in the introduction to  volatile earlier in
this chapter, that the JIT compiler may optimize code by creating thread local copies
of any non-volatile field.

Consider the following code:

    int operation(Item a, Item b) {
        return (a.value + b.value) * a.value;
    }

The compiler might choose to optimize the previous method to the assembly
equivalent of:

    int operation(Item a, Item b) {
        int tmp = a.value;
        return (tmp + b.value) * tmp;
    }

Notice how two field loads turned into one. Depending on CPU architecture, this
will lead to a smaller or larger performance increase if the method is hot. However, it
is almost certainly a good idea for the JIT compiler to try to eliminate loads wherever
possible, as memory access is always orders of magnitude more expensive than
register access. The equivalent optimization is performed by compilers in virtually
all statically compiled languages, and not being able to perform it in Java would lead
to severe performance loss in comparison.

Originally, through some oversights in the original Java Memory Model, this kind
of optimization wasn't guaranteed to be allowed (if it couldn't be proven that  a and
b were the same object). Luckily, the new Java Memory Model allows this kind of
optimization as long as the  value field isn't declared  volatile . The new memory
model allows any thread to keep local copies of non-volatile field values, as was
also illustrated with the potentially infinite loop on the field  finished earlier in
this chapter.

#### 4.3.1.1.1 Immutability

One of the most surprising problems in the original Java Memory Model was that
objects that were declared  final were sometimes not in fact  final (immutable) at
all.  final objects were defined to require no synchronization, intuitively through
their immutability, but there were problems. These manifested themselves to the
ordinary user in unexpected ways. A final instance field in a Java object is assigned
its one and only value in a constructor, but as all uninitialized fields, it also has
an implicit default value ( 0 or maybe  null ) before the constructor is run. Without
explicit synchronization, the old memory model could allow a different thread
to temporarily see this default value of the field before the assignment in the
constructor had been committed to memory.

This issue typically led to problems with  String instances. A  String instance
contains a  char array with its text, a start offset in the array for where the text begins
and a length. All these fields are  final and immutable, just like  String s themselves
are guaranteed to be in the Java language. So, two  String objects can save memory
by reusing the same immutable  char array. For example, the  String "cat" may
point out the same  char array as the  String "housecat", but with a start offset of  5
instead of  0 . However, the old memory model would allow the  String object for
"cat" to be visible with its uninitialized (zeroed) start offsets for a very short period
of time, before its constructor was run, basically allowing other threads to think it
was spelling out "housecat" very briefly until it became "cat". This clearly violates the
immutability of a  java.lang.String .

The new memory model has fixed this problem, and final fields without
synchronization are indeed immutable. Note that there can still be problems if
an object with final fields is badly constructed, so that the  this reference is allowed
to escape the constructor before it has finished executing.
