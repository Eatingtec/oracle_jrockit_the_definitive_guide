## 4.4.1 锁膨胀与锁收缩

As was mentioned when the different types of locks were introduced, one of the
most important optimizations in an adaptive runtime is the ability to convert
thin locks to fat locks and vice versa, depending on load and contention. Both the
code generator and the lock implementation will attempt to solve this problem as
efficiently as possible.

In an adaptive environment, the runtime has the benefit of free lock profiling
information (at least a small amount of free lock profiling information, as, we shall see,
doing complete in-depth lock profiling incurs some runtime overhead). Whenever a
lock is taken or released, information can be logged about who is trying to get the lock
and how many times it has been contended. So, if a single thread has failed to acquire
a thin lock in too many subsequent attempts, it makes good sense for the virtual
machine to convert it to a fat lock. The fat lock is better suited for handling contention,
in that waiting threads sleep instead of spin and therefore use less CPU cycles. We
refer to the practice of converting a thin lock to a fat lock as lock inflation.

>JRockit, by default, also uses a small spinlock to implement a fat
lock while it has been recently inflated and held only for a very
short time. This might seem counterintuitive, but is generally
beneficial. This behavior can be turned off from the command
line (with the flag –XX:UseFatSpin=false), if deemed too
slow—for example, in an environment with highly contended
locks with long waiting periods. The spinlock that is part of
the fat lock can also be made adaptive and based on runtime
feedback. This is turned off by default, but can be enabled with
the command-line flag –XX:UseAdaptiveFatSpin=true.

In the same manner, when many subsequent unlocks of a fat lock have been done
without any other thread being queued on its lock or wait queue, it makes sense to
turn the fat lock into a thin lock again. We refer to this as lock deflation.

JRockit uses heuristics to perform both inflation and deflation, thus adapting to the
changed behavior of a given program where, for example, locks that were contended
in the beginning of program execution stop being contended. Then these locks are
candidates for deflation.

The heuristics that trigger transitions between thin and fat locks can be overridden and
modified from the command line if needed, but this is generally not recommended.
The next chapter will briefly discuss how to do this.
