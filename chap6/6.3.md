# 6.3 处理连接问题

如果无法自动发现本地的JRockit JVM，可以从以下几方面入手检查：

* 如果是运行在Windows系统上，检查系统临时目录是否支持文件权限控制（例如NTFS是支持的）。这是必要的，因为本地连接需要依据文件访问权限创建所需临时文件，而在FAT这类文件系统上，是无法进行的。
* 连接目标是否运行在JRockit JVM上？JRockit Mission Control客户端是否运行在JRockit JVM上？
* 链接目标和JRockit Mission Control客户端使用的是否都是JDK 1.5之上的版本？
* 是否有权限连接目标JVM？

>若目标JVM使用的是JDK 1.4版本，则需要在JRockit Mission Control的JVM浏览器视图中手动新建一个连接，然后在目标JRockit JVM上显式开启管理代理。这是因为在JDK 1.4版本中还没有出现MBean服务器的概念，而JRockit 1.4版本中实现了一个私有的管理协议，称为RMP，在客户端会被转换为JMX。要想启动代理，可以通过添加命令行参数，或使用JRCMD工具实现（参见第11章的介绍）。

If you are having problems connecting to an external management agent (usually,
but not necessarily, one running on a remote machine) you should check:

•  Is the connection properly configured? There is a test button in the
connection wizard that will verify the settings for you. If you are trying
to connect to a JDK 1.4 version of the JRockit JVM, you should be using
a 3.x client.
•  Is the correct version of the client being used? The easiest way to be sure is to
use the version that came with the JVM. If attempting to connect to a JDK 1.4
version of the JRockit JVM, a 3.x version should be used.
•  Is the 1.4/1.5 setting correct in the Connection Wizard?
•  Is the firewall configured to let the traffic through on the appropriate ports?
•  If SSL is being used, are the SSL settings correct on both the server and
the client?
•  If authentication is enabled, is the  jmxremote.access file properly set up, as
described in the Java SE documentation?
•  Verify the  hosts file of the machine to which you are trying to connect.

While troubleshooting connections to the remote management agent, first make
sure that the connection works with SSL and that authentication is turned off. If that
works, make sure that all the steps in the Running in a Secure Environment section
have been followed, that the certificate is valid, that the keystore password is correct,
and that the  password.properties file has been properly configured.

If the Management Console tells you that a certain MBean, for instance the Profiling
MBean, cannot be found, it may be due to a misconfigured  jmxremote.access file.
To be able to initialize JMXMAPI, the user must have authorization to create the
JRockitConsole MBean that, in turn, will initialize the rest of the JMXMAPI. See the
Running in a Secure Environment section for more information.
