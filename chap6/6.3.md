# 6.3 处理连接问题

如果无法连接到本地的JRockit JVM，可以从以下几方面入手检查：

* If you are running on Windows, verify that the system temporary directory
is on a file system that supports file permissions (for example NTFS). This is
required. Local connections will create artifacts that rely on file permissions
to work, and will simply fail if running on a FAT file system.
*  Are you really attempting to connect to a JRockit JVM, and is the Mission
Control client (or Eclipse, if running in Eclipse) running on a JRockit JVM?
*  If a local connection is attempted, are both your JRockit Mission Control
Client and the JRockit JVM that you are attempting to connect to, using
a JDK version of 1.5 or later?
*  Is the JVM you are trying to connect to executing as your user?

>To connect to a locally executing 1.4 version of the JRockit JVM, create
a connection manually in the JRockit Mission Control JVM Browser.
Then start the management agent explicitly on the JRockit JVM that
you want to monitor. This is because 1.4 versions of the JVM really do
not have a platform MBean server. JRockit 1.4 versions did, however,
implement a proprietary management protocol called RMP that is
translated to JMX on the client. Starting the agent can either be done
by using the command-line options as described earlier, or by using
the JRCMD tool, described in Chapter 11.

If you are having problems connecting to an external management agent (usually,
but not necessarily, one running on a remote machine) you should check:

•  Is the connection properly configured? There is a test button in the
connection wizard that will verify the settings for you. If you are trying
to connect to a JDK 1.4 version of the JRockit JVM, you should be using
a 3.x client.
•  Is the correct version of the client being used? The easiest way to be sure is to
use the version that came with the JVM. If attempting to connect to a JDK 1.4
version of the JRockit JVM, a 3.x version should be used.
•  Is the 1.4/1.5 setting correct in the Connection Wizard?
•  Is the firewall configured to let the traffic through on the appropriate ports?
•  If SSL is being used, are the SSL settings correct on both the server and
the client?
•  If authentication is enabled, is the  jmxremote.access file properly set up, as
described in the Java SE documentation?
•  Verify the  hosts file of the machine to which you are trying to connect.

While troubleshooting connections to the remote management agent, first make
sure that the connection works with SSL and that authentication is turned off. If that
works, make sure that all the steps in the Running in a Secure Environment section
have been followed, that the certificate is valid, that the keystore password is correct,
and that the  password.properties file has been properly configured.

If the Management Console tells you that a certain MBean, for instance the Profiling
MBean, cannot be found, it may be due to a misconfigured  jmxremote.access file.
To be able to initialize JMXMAPI, the user must have authorization to create the
JRockitConsole MBean that, in turn, will initialize the rest of the JMXMAPI. See the
Running in a Secure Environment section for more information.
