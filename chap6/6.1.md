# 6.1 相关背景

起初，JRockit Mission Control只是JRockit开发团队用来对JRockit JVM进行监控和调试的内部工具集。这些分析工具本身并非为用户而开发，不过在为用户解决了不少高端问题后，顿时威名远扬，同时开发团队意识到，这些工具对用户分析其应用程序是很有帮助的，于是他们将这些分析工具做得更加易用，更具模块性，并作为Java相关工具随JRockit JDK一起发布，这就是后来的JRockit Mission Control。

Today, the JRockit Mission Control tools suite is a set of tools for monitoring,
managing and profiling Java applications running on JRockit. It also includes a
powerful tool for tracking down memory leaks. The JRockit Mission Control tools
can, with very little overhead, retrieve a profile that is a fair approximation of the
actual runtime behavior of an application. Most other profilers cause significant
slowdowns which, in turn, can alter the behavior of the running application. As
mentioned in Chapter 5, Benchmarking and Tuning, if a lot of overhead is incurred
from the actual profiler, it is fair to say that what is being observed is no longer a
true representation of the application behavior. It is rather the behavior of the
application, plus that of the profiler itself, that is being profiled.

>Behavior change in an application due to profiling is sometimes
referred to as the observer effect—when the act of observation
alters what is being observed. The term Heisenberg effect is also
sometimes used. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is related to,
and often conflated with, the observer effect.
>In a BEA internal study, before the Oracle acquisition, the BEA
performance team was benchmarking different profilers. They were
looking for a low overhead tool to profile a J2EE benchmark on
WebLogic Server. Several different profilers were examined, and the
overhead as a function of change in response time was calculated.
For this particular benchmark, the overhead for Mission Control was
0.5 percent. The second best tool, a leading Java profiler, incurred
93.8 percent (!) overhead on that very same benchmark.
