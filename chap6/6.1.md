JRockit Mission Control started out as a set of internal tools used by the JRockit team
to monitor and tune the JRockit JVM in order to make it a better Java runtime. The
early analysis tools were initially not available to end customers. However, after we
used the tools to resolve a couple of high profile customer issues, the word started
to spread. We realized that customers found the tools useful when tuning and
profiling their Java applications, and consequently the tools were made more
user friendly, packaged together, and released as the Java tools suite known as
JRockit Mission Control.

Today, the JRockit Mission Control tools suite is a set of tools for monitoring,
managing and profiling Java applications running on JRockit. It also includes a
powerful tool for tracking down memory leaks. The JRockit Mission Control tools
can, with very little overhead, retrieve a profile that is a fair approximation of the
actual runtime behavior of an application. Most other profilers cause significant
slowdowns which, in turn, can alter the behavior of the running application. As
mentioned in Chapter 5, Benchmarking and Tuning, if a lot of overhead is incurred
from the actual profiler, it is fair to say that what is being observed is no longer a
true representation of the application behavior. It is rather the behavior of the
application, plus that of the profiler itself, that is being profiled.

>Behavior change in an application due to profiling is sometimes
referred to as the observer effect—when the act of observation
alters what is being observed. The term Heisenberg effect is also
sometimes used. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is related to,
and often conflated with, the observer effect.
>In a BEA internal study, before the Oracle acquisition, the BEA
performance team was benchmarking different profilers. They were
looking for a low overhead tool to profile a J2EE benchmark on
WebLogic Server. Several different profilers were examined, and the
overhead as a function of change in response time was calculated.
For this particular benchmark, the overhead for Mission Control was
0.5 percent. The second best tool, a leading Java profiler, incurred
93.8 percent (!) overhead on that very same benchmark.
