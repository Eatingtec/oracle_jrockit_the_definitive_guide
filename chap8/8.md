# 8 Runtime Analyzer

The JRockit Runtime Analyzer, or JRA for short, is a JRockit-specific profiling tool
that provides information about both the JRockit runtime and the application running
in JRockit. JRA was the main profiling tool for JRockit R27 and earlier, but has been
superseded in later versions by the JRockit Flight Recorder. Because of its extremely
low overhead, JRA is suitable for use in production.

In this chapter you will learn:
•  Different ways to create a JRA recording
•  How to find the hot spots in your application
•  How to interpret memory-related information in JRA
•  How to hunt down latency-related problems
•  How to detect indications of a memory leak in an application
•  How to use the operative set in the JRA latency analyzer component

This chapter is mainly targeted at R27.x/3.x versions of JRockit and
Mission Control. The next chapter covers performing and analyzing
runtime recordings in R28/4.0 using JRockit Flight Recorder. As
several of the components for recording analysis in Mission Control
are similar in R28, they are introduced in this chapter. Where
applicable, the next chapter covers new components and the most
important differences between R27.x/3.x and R28/4.0.
