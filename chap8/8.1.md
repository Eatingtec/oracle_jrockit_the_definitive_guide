# 8.1 反馈信息的必要性

JRockit成为业界领先的JVM，离不开用户的大力协助。JRockit致力于提供服务器端应用程序的性能和扩展性，最具相关性的反馈信息往往来自于部署了大量服务器的用户，例如金融行业的用户。JRockit  Runtime Analyzer，或简称JRA，最初是为了收集JRockit的性能信息而进行开发。

其实，用户并不太愿意将其应用程序相关的敏感数据发给JRockit开发团队，当然更不会让JRockit开发团队在其生产环境中做性能分析，因为某些用户应用程序每周所处理的资金流水可能高达每周数十亿美元。故而，就需要有一种工具来帮助收集JRockit和其中的应用程序的的运行情况，这样既有助于改进JRockit，还可以发现用户应用程序有哪些异常行为。当然，要想实现这个工具会面临一些挑战。要想准确的找到系统性能瓶颈，就需要准确测量系统各个参数，此外，还要尽可能降低工具的执行开销。如果工具本身会产生较大的执行开销，也就无法获知系统的真实运行情况了，用户也肯定不会在生产环境中使用这个工具。

作为一款记录应用程序运行时信息的工具，JRA使用非常方便，而且能够提供足够多的信息来优化JRockit。今天，作为问题诊断和性能调优工具，JRA已经获得用户的广泛赞誉。

起初，JRA使用XML文档来记录运行时信息，这样既方便开发人员进行调试，也可以让用户知晓具体有哪些信息被记录了下来。后来，JRockit的开发人员调整了记录信息的内容，加入了与系统延迟相关的数据，于是乎，JRA记录的数据就被分成了两部分，分别是具备可读性的XML文件，和记录了延迟事件的二进制数据。在记录运行时信息的过程中，延迟信息存储在JRockit的内存缓冲区中，同时，为了避免引入额外的延迟和性能损耗，延迟信息是直接从内存缓冲区直接写入到磁盘的。

因此，JRA生成的文件有两种类型，**.jra**和 **.jfr**，分别对应于JRockit R28之前和之后的不同版本。在JRockit R28版本之前，JRA输出的文件中主要是没有关联数据模型的XML文档，而到了R28版本之后，记录文件中保存了关联着事件模型的二进制数据，更便于使用分析工具进行性能分析。

若想打开JFR的记录文件，必须要使用JRockit Mission Control 3.x版本；而若要打开Flight Recorder的记录文件，则至少要使用JRockit Mission Control 4.0以上的版本才行。

## 8.1.1 记录

通过以下几种方可以控制开启/结束对运行时信息的记录：

* 使用JRCMD命令行工具。更多有关JRCMD的内容，请参见[第11章][2]。
* 使用JVM命令行参数。这方面更多的内容，请参见JRockit文档中有关`-XXjra`参数的描述。
* 使用JRockit Mission Control套件中的JRA图形化工具。

当然，最简单的方法还是在JRockit Mission Control GUI中通过JRA/JFR的提示创建完成对记录信息的控制。在JVM浏览器展示区中选择目标JVM后，点击工具栏中的JRA按钮即可，或者在上下文菜单中开启JRA记录。通常情况下，使用预定义的配置即可，如有特殊需要的话，可以性调整。在JRockit Mission Control 3.x版本中，预定义的配置如下图所示：

•  Full Recording: This is the standard use case. By default, it is configured to
do a five minute recording that contains most data of interest.
•  Minimal Overhead Recording: This template can be used for very
latency-sensitive applications. It will, for example, not record heap statistics,
as the gathering of heap statistics will, in effect, cause an extra garbage
collection at the beginning and at the end of the recording.
•  Real Time Recording: This template is useful when hunting latency-related
problems, for instance when tuning a system that is running on JRockit
Real Time. This template provides an additional text field for setting the
latency threshold. The latency threshold is explained later in the chapter in
the section on the latency analyzer. The threshold is by default lowered to 5
milliseconds for this type of recording, from the default 20 milliseconds, and
the default recording time is longer.
•  Classic Recording: This resembles a classic JRA recording from earlier
versions of Mission Control. Most notably, it will not contain any latency
data. Use this template with JRockit versions prior to R27.3 or if there is no
interest in recording latency data.

All recording templates can be customized by checking the Show advanced options
check box. This is usually not needed, but let's go through the options and why you
may want to change them:

•  Enable GC sampling: This option selects whether or not GC-related
information should be recorded. It can be turned off if you know that you
will not be interested in GC-related information. It is on by default, and it is a
good idea to keep it enabled.
•  Enable method sampling: This option enables or disables method sampling.
Method sampling is implemented by using sample data from the JRockit
code optimizer. If profiling overhead is a concern (it is usually very low, but
still), it is usually a good idea to use the Method sample interval option to
control how much method sampling information to record.
•  Enable native sampling: This option determines whether or not to attempt
to sample time spent executing native code as a part of the method sampling.
This feature is disabled by default, as it is mostly used by JRockit developers
and support. Most Java developers probably do fine without it.
•  Hardware method sampling: On some hardware architectures, JRockit
can make use of special hardware counters in the CPU to provide higher
resolution for the method sampling. This option only makes sense on such
architectures. Chapter 2, Adaptive Code Generation discusses hardware-based
sampling to a greater extent.
•  Stack traces: Use this option to not only get sample counts but also stack traces
from method samples. If this is disabled, no call traces are available for sample
points in the methods that show up in the Hot Methods list.
•  Trace depth: This setting determines how many stack frames to retrieve
for each stack trace. For JRockit Mission Control versions prior to 4.0, this
defaulted to the rather limited depth of 16. For applications running in
application containers or using large frameworks, this is usually way too
low to generate data from which any useful conclusions can be drawn. A tip,
when profiling such an application, would be to bump this to 30 or more.
•  Method sampling interval: This setting controls how often thread samples
should be taken. JRockit will stop a subset of the threads every Method
sample interval milliseconds in a round robin fashion. Only threads
executing when the sample is taken will be counted, not blocking threads.
Use this to find out where the computational load in an application takes
place. See the section, Hot Methods for more information.
•  Thread dumps: When enabled, JRockit will record a thread stack dump at
the beginning and the end of the recording. If the Thread dump interval
setting is also specified, thread dumps will be recorded at regular intervals
for the duration of the recording.
•  Thread dump interval: This setting controls how often, in seconds, to record
the thread stack dumps mentioned earlier.
•  Latencies: If this setting is enabled, the JRA recording will contain latency
data. For more information on latencies, please refer to the section Latency
later in this chapter.
•  Latency threshold: To limit the amount of data in the recording, it is possible
to set a threshold for the minimum latency (duration) required for an event to
actually be recorded. This is normally set to 20 milliseconds. It is usually safe
to lower this to around 1 millisecond without incurring too much profiling
overhead. Less than that and there is a risk that the profiling overhead will
become unacceptably high and/or that the file size of the recording becomes
unmanageably large. Latency thresholds can be set as low as nanosecond
values by changing the unit in the unit combo box.
•  Enable CPU sampling: When this setting is enabled, JRockit will record the
CPU load at regular intervals.
•  Heap statistics: This setting causes JRockit to do a heap analysis pass at the
beginning and at the end of the recording. As heap analysis involves forcing
extra garbage collections at these points in order to collect information, it is
disabled in the low overhead template.
•  Delay before starting a recording: This option can be used to schedule the
recording to start at a later time. The delay is normally defined in minutes,
but the unit combo box can be used to specify the time in a more appropriate
unit—everything from seconds to days is supported.

Before starting the recording, a location to which the finished recording is to be
downloaded must be specified. Once the JRA recording is started, an editor will open
up showing the options with which the recording was started and a progress bar.
When the recording is completed, it is downloaded and the editor input is changed
to show the contents of the recording.
