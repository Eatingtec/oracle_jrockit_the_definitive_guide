# 11.3 JRCMD的限制

JDK中的tools.jar包中包含了可以动态连接到正在运行的JVM的Attach API。JRockit Mission Control使用Attach API来检测本地系统中正在运行的JVM，以及调用相关的诊断命令。

When a JVM is started, an entry will be created in the temporary directory of the
user starting the JVM process. These entries can then be used by JRCMD, through
the Java Attach API, to find the JVMs started by the same user as the one running
JRCMD. For this to be secure, the Attach API relies on a properly set up temporary
directory on a file system with per-file access rights. This means that if the folder
is on an insecure file system, such as FAT; JRCMD will not work. It also means
that the user running JRCMD and the user running the Java process must be the
same. Another implication is that a Java process running as a service on Windows
will not be reachable from a JRCMD started from the desktop—they are running
in different environments.



When a JRockit process is started as root and then has its ownership changed to a
less privileged user, JRCMD will not be able to communicate properly with that
process anymore due to security restrictions. Root will be able to list the process, but
any attempt to send a command will be interpreted as a SIGQUIT and print a thread
dump instead. The less privileged user will not be able to list the process, but if the
PID of the process is known, commands can still be sent to it.

The rest of this chapter is dedicated to explaining some commonly used
diagnostic commands.
