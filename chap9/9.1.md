# 9.1 JRA进化

想JRA一样，JFR中也包含了两大部分，分别是内建于JRockit JVM的记录引擎和内建于JRockit Mission Control客户端的分析记录分析工具。记录引擎用于生成可供分析工具处理的记录文件，分析文件时，并不要求必须有活动连接，其本身是自描述的，即文件本身就包含了所有相关的元数据。此外，该文件也可以被发送给其他第3方分析工具做进一步的详细分析。

>在本章中，JFR和JFA表示同一个意思，可以互换使用。

在JFR中，记录文件不再使用XML格式，所有内容均记录在内存缓冲区中，并辅以相应的时间戳，并在合适的时机将之写入到构成记录的二进制文件中，此外，还通过专门的Java API实现了自定义事件和自定义用户分析接口的功能。

>在[第8章][1]中曾经提到过，JRA的记录是以XML格式存储的，其记录文件的后缀名为`.jra`。而在JFR中，文件后缀名变成了`.jfr`，存储格式也改成了二进制格式。由于可能会产生大量的目标事件，因此需要避免不必要的开销，将数据压缩存储。JRA记录无法向前兼容，JFR也无法打开JRA的记录文件。

## 9.1.1 关于事件

正如前面介绍的，在JFR中，事件就是在某个具体的时间点记录下的数据。

其中，事件包含一下种类型：

* **持续事件（duration event）**： 指包含了起始时间和截止时间的事件，例如 **Garbage Collection**事件。
* **计时事件（timed event）**： 指可以设置持续时间阈值的持续事件，例如 **Java Wait**事件和 **Java Sleep**事件。
* **立即事件（instant event）**： 指事件不会持续，记录的内容也只有开始时间，例如 **Exception**和 **Event Settings Changed**异常设置变更事件。
* **可请求事件（requestable event）**： 指可以被配置为周期性轮询记录引擎的事件。该事件是通过在记录引擎中使用一个单独的线程来定时调用指定方法实现的，例如 **CPU Load Sample**事件。

JFR中记录的事件由记录生成器产生，记录生成器定义了事件的具体类型。事件类型中包含了用于描述该类型本身信息的元数据。这些元数据中包含了该事件本身所包含的属性信息、属性的类型信息和属性的具体描述信息。JFR的记录文件中都包含了对该事件生成器的描述信息。

JRockit JVM作为其中一种事件生成器，优势巨大，它可以以较小的运行时代价，很方便的记录下运行时需要收集的事件信息。此外，用户可以通过调用相关的Java API，在JRockit JVM创建的底层事件上附加额外的上下文属性。

## 9.1.2 记录引擎

The recording engine, also known as the recording agent, is part of the JVM itself 
and provides highly optimized services for the event producers. A few examples are:

•	 A recording facility: Of course, the main purpose of the recording engine 
is to record events. It does this highly efficiently by providing thread local 
buffers where the events are recorded and a scheme to transfer these to a 
global buffer when the thread local buffers are full. Once the global buffer is 
full, it is either emitted to disk in the previously mentioned compact binary 
format, or reused in a circular fashion depending on the configuration. See 
the next figure.
•	 Stack traces: If the event producer sets the appropriate options, the stack 
trace that generated the event will be recorded along with the event. 
This is useful for finding where, in the source code of a Java application, 
an event originated.
•	 Threshold: The recording engine can be configured to only include duration 
events that last longer than a specified amount of time. This is used to both 
limit the amount of data in the recording, and to filter out data that would be 
of no interest anyway. The threshold can be configured per event type.
•	 Highly optimized time stamping of events: As was briefly discussed in 
Chapter 5, Benchmarking and Tuning, using System.currentTimeMillis()
for getting the system time can be a much more expensive operation than 
one would think. The recording engine provides a highly optimized native 
implementation for timestamping events.

>As JRockit R28 is released as part of a patch release of the application 
stack, it was decided that enabling the default recording was too 
big a change. The recording engine is enabled in R28, but there is 
no recording running from the start of the JVM. Both the recording 
engine and the JRockit JVM event producer have been designed and 
tested for always being enabled. As a matter of fact, all of the testing, 
including the stress testing of JRockit R28, was performed with the 
default recording enabled. The default recording will most likely be 
enabled out of the box in future releases of JRockit.

Ongoing recordings in the JVM have an associated recording ID, which is unique, 
and a recording name, which does not have to be. The recording ID is automatically 
assigned to the recording when it is created, and can be used for identifying a 
recording. The recording ID can, for example, be used when referring to a 
recording from JRCMD.

To enable the Flight Recorder and to configure it to continuously record data with 
the default settings, simply start JRockit with the following option:

    -XX:FlightRecorderOptions=defaultrecording=true

This will create a recording with recording ID 0 and the name JRockit default.

There can be an arbitrary amount of recordings running in JRockit Flight Recorder 
at any given time. If more than one recording is active, the recorded data will contain 
events from the union of the enabled event types and use the threshold found for 
each type. For users new to the Flight Recorder, this can be quite confusing, as there 
may actually be more events in the recording than asked for.

To configure the engine to record more detailed information, you can either change 
the event settingsof the default recording, or start a new recording with different 
settings. To record less information, the event settings of any ongoing recording 
must be changed.
