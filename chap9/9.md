The overhead of using JRA proved so low that we started considering the notion of 
always having it enabled when the JVM is running. The project to implement such a 
recording engine was internally first known as continuous JRA.In the R28 version 
of JRockit, this has finally been productized and named JRockit Flight Recorder.



As near-zero overhead data is continuously stored about JVM behavior, the 
JRockit Flight Recorder allows us to go back in time and analyze the behavior of 
the application and the JVM even aftersomething has gone wrong. This is a very 
powerful feature for JVM and application forensics—the recording being the "black 
box" that contains information on all events leading up to a problem. Naturally, the 
framework still works well as a profiling and instrumentation tool, which will likely 
remain the most common use case.
