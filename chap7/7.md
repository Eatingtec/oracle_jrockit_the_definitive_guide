# 7 Management Console

The oldest tool in the JRockit Mission Control tools suite is the JRockit Management
Console. The Management Console can be used to monitor the JRockit JVM and
any application running in the JVM. It can also be used to alter the runtime state
of certain parameters in JRockit. This chapter assumes some prior familiarity with
Java Management Extensions (JMX) and the JMX terminology.

The Management Console relies on the JMX standard and provides a way to
monitor any application that exposes manageability features through JMX,
including the JRockit JVM.
