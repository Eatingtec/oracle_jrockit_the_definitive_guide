# 7.1 JMX Management Console

JRockit Management Console的诞生时间要遭遇JRockit Mission Control套件，事实上，比JMX的诞生还要早。

>JRockit最初的几个版本是定位于"可以运行Java的虚拟机器"，而不是JVM，这里面的关键区别在于，只有经过Sun公司（现在是Oracle公司）认证的、遵循Java标准的虚拟机器，才可以被称为"JVM"。进一步来说，如果某款JVM未经过认证，则不可以使用Java商标。在当时，若想获得Sun公司的认证，就必须要有一些"增值特性"。那时的想法是把"超强性能"作为"增值特性"，不过从技术上讲，这不算是一个有效的"增值特性"，于是改为以JVM的在线管理功能作为"增值特性"，并在后来逐步发展成为JRockit Management Console。

The primary use of the Management Console is to provide detailed monitoring of one
or more JRockit instances. As each monitored JVM has its own Management Console
(editor), more than a few JVM instances are rarely monitored at a time. To monitor
large installations for longer periods of time, a distributed solution that scales well
over large amounts of JVMs should be used, such as Oracle Enterprise Manager.

The Management Console and JRockit use standard JMX technology for
communication. As of Java 5.0, some aspects of using JMX to expose manageability
features of the JVM are standardized through JSR-174.

>JSR-174 enhanced the manageability of the JVM by adding the java.
lang.management classes and providing the platform MBean server.
For more information on the platform MBean server, see the Java APIs
and Documentation on SDN on the Internet and search for java.lang.
management.ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer()

Since the advent of JSR-174 and the platform MBean server, most Java applications
and frameworks are publishing their monitoring and management MBeans to the
platform MBean server, which in effect means that the Management Console can
monitor most parts of the software stack running in the JVM.

As JRockit had a Management Console well before the start of JSR-174, the JRockit
Management Console can also connect to pre 1.5.0 versions of JRockit. In these
setups, everything still looks like JMX to the client, but underneath a proprietary
protocol is used.

The rest of this chapter is dedicated to discussing the JRockit Mission Control
Console and its various uses. The chapter is divided into sections corresponding
to the different tabs in the Management Console, so that it can also be used as a
reference to quickly check on details for a specific tab.
