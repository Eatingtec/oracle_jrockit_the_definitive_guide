# 7.3 扩展JRockit Mission Control Console

This section is for developers interested in extending the JRockit Mission Control
Management Console with custom tabs. It assumes some familiarity with the Eclipse
platform and terminology, such as extension point and form page.

There is an extension point available for the console that can be used to implement
custom tabs. This extension point was, for instance, used when creating the JConsole
plug-in tab available from the JRockit Mission Control experimental update site. See
the previous chapter for more information on the experimental update site.

The easiest way to get started building your own JRockit Mission Control Console
plug-in is to use the PDE wizard available from the experimental update site. First
make sure that Eclipse for RCP/Plug-in Developers (Eclipse 3.5/Ganymede or later
versions) is installed. Next install the JRockit Mission Control Plug-in into Eclipse.
Finally install the PDE Integration Plug-in from the experimental update site.

>PDE is short for Plug-in Development Environment, which is a set
of tools built into Eclipse to help create, develop, test, debug, build,
and deploy Eclipse plug-ins. The PDE Integration Plug-in from the
experimental update site provides specialized wizards and templates
that make it easier to write plug-ins for JRockit Mission Control.

The available console PDE wizards can be used to generate the boilerplate code
needed to contribute custom tabs to the JRockit Mission Control Console. They
also serve as examples on how custom tabs can be implemented.

There are two different wizards for creating JRockit Mission Control tabs available in
the PDE plug-in—simple and advanced. The simple wizard will generate an example
tab that shows a label with the CPU load. The advanced wizard will use various
components built into the JRockit Mission Control console to show three selected
attributes in various different ways.

This section walks you through how to create a new tab project:

1. Select File | New | Project...

![Figure 7-33][1]

2. In the New Project dialog box, select Plug-in Project and click on Next.

![Figure 7-34][2]

3. Name your project. It is common practice to name the plug-in project after
the main package of your plug-in, for example  com.example.mc.console.
myplugin .

4. Ensure that the correct target platform is selected (Eclipse 3.4 for JRockit
Mission Control 3.1 and Eclipse 3.5 for JRockit Mission Control 4.0).

![Figure 7-35][3]

5. Click on Next and optionally change plug-in property details. When
satisfied, click on Next again.

6. If the PDE plug-in is correctly installed, you should now be presented with
numerous templates, two of which should be the advanced and simple
console tab ones. Select either the advanced or the simple one and then click
on Next.

7. Change the details to match your plug-in and then click on Finish.

The end result should be a plug-in project with all the necessary code for an
additional tab in the JRockit Mission Control Console. To try out your new tab,
simply go to Run | Run Configurations... In the Run Configurations Dialog,
right click on Eclipse Application and select New. This will create a new run
configuration for launching Eclipse. By default, it should be using the Eclipse
in which you are developing as a target platform and include all the plug-ins
in your workspace. As your Eclipse includes the JRockit Mission Control
plug-in, everything should be fine. Select the new configuration and press
the Run button in the lower right corner.

A new Eclipse should be launched with your brand new plug-in deployed. Open up
the Mission Control perspective the way you normally would and start the console.
Your tab will show up under the Other tab group.

If the advanced wizard was used, a class containing the code for creating a
tab looking much like the standard Overview tab should have been created.
It displays three different attributes in various different ways.

![Figure 7-38][6]

Setting up the tab is done programmatically and the code for it is rather simple.
The extension point only requires us to subclass  org.eclipse.ui.forms.editor.
FormPage. So, there are really no dependencies on JRockit or JRockit Mission
Control specific classes for the extension point itself. The editor input from the form
page can be adapted to an  IMBeanService , which is a communication helper service
for the console available in the  com.jrockit.mc.rjmx.core package.

    private IMBeanService getMBeanService() {
        return (IMBeanService)getEditorInput().getAdapter(IMBeanService.class);
    }

This allows access to the JRockit Mission Control specific MBean layer residing in the
com.jrockit.mc.rjmx* plug-ins. RJMX provides, among other things, access to the
subscription engine and the proxy layer in JRockit Mission Control.

The proxy layer can be used to access JRockit specific attributes and operations
in a version neutral way with respect to the API. Use  getMBeanService().
getProxyNames() for the attributes and  getMBeanService().
getProxyOperations() for the operations.

For example, the location of the attribute for the CPU load is different in JRockit
versions R26.4 , R27.x, and R28.x. To get the location of the CPU load, regardless
of JRockit version, the proxy layer can be used like this:

    getMBeanService().getProxyNames().getAttributeDescriptor(IProxyNames.Key.OS_CPU_LOAD);

This will return an attribute descriptor containing the MBean  ObjectName
and attribute name needed to locate the attribute. Most of RJMX makes use
of attribute descriptors that are objects encapsulating the MBean  ObjectName
and the attribute name.

This is how we create an attribute descriptor directly pointing to the CPU load where
it is located in R28 versions of JRockit:

    new AttributeDescriptor("oracle.jrockit.management:type=Runtime","CPULoad");

To invoke a garbage collection, regardless of JRockit version, the proxy layer can be
used in the following way:

    getMBeanService().getProxyOperations().gc();

As can be seen from the advanced template code, adding a table for a collection of
attributes is very easy.

    builder.setProperty(AttributeVisualizerBuilder.TITLE, "Chart");
    builder.setProperty(AttributeVisualizerBuilder.TITLE_AXIS_Y, "%");
    builder.setProperty(AttributeVisualizerBuilder.TITLE_AXIS_X, "Time");
    addAttributesToVisualizer(builder.createChart());

The simple template is actually a little bit more complex than it seems, as it uses the
different services directly and does not rely on the standard Mission Control GUI
components. The resulting GUI is, however, much simpler. The tab generated from
the simple template provides a good example for how to use the RJMX subscription
service. The subscription service allows subscribing to the values of one or more
attributes using the same subscription mechanism as the rest of the console. Adding
a subscription to the CPU load is done by using the  SubscriptionService 

    getMBeanService().getAttributeSubscriptionService()
        .addAttributeValueListener(getMBeanService().getProxyNames().
        getAttributeDescriptor(IProxyNames.Key.OS_CPU_LOAD),new LabelUpdater(valueLabel));

The  LabelUpdater is a simple implementation of the  IAttributeValueListener
interface defined in the  com.jrockit.mc.rjmx.subscription package. Each time a
new value is retrieved, the  valueChanged method is called with an event containing
the value. Note that there are no guarantees as to which thread is delivering the event.
In the current implementation, it will either be the subscription thread (most events)
or the JMX subsystem (notification based events). It will very likely never be the GUI
thread, which means that any updates to the GUI will need to be posted to the GUI
thread, as done by using  DisplayToolkit.safeAsyncExec in the  LabelUpdater
example code:

    public static class LabelUpdater implements IAttributeValueListener {
        private final Label label;
        public LabelUpdater(Label label) {
            this.label = label;
        }
        public void valueChanged(final AttributeValueEvent event) {
            DisplayToolkit.safeAsyncExec(label, new Runnable(){
                public void run() {
                    Double latestValue = (Double) event.getValue();
                    label.setText("CPU Load is: "+ (latestValue.doubleValue() * 100) + "%");
                }
            });
        }
    }

Creating an extension for a trigger action is done in the same way. Simply select the
Mission Control Trigger Action Wizard template from the plug-in project wizard
in step 6.
