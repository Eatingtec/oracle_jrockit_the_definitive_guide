# 5.4 工业标准的基准测试

这些年来，工业界与学术界一直在努力在基准测试中模拟出Java应用程序可能会遇到的各种问题，对此，JVM厂商和硬件厂商当然是举双手欢迎，因为这不但可以提升JVM的运行效率，还有利于产品推广，标准化的基准测试通常会设计出与JVM调优相关的一些细节。为了能够更好的理解在不同的场景下应如何使用JVM，建议开发人员查看一下针对相关问题的基准测试报告。

自然地，基准测试的对象延展到了与编程相关的方方面面，很多软件栈都旨在提供标准化性能测量，测量对象无所不包，从应用程序服务器到网络库等等。对于Java开发人员来说，选择并使用相关的基准测试也算是一种修炼了。

>本节会以JVM位中心对基准测试进行介绍。了解如何JVM，以及如何做相关配置是很有意思的，所以本节中选用JVM厂商常用的几种基准测试套件做重点介绍。在之前的章节中已经介绍了优化JVM对不同类型应用程序的影响，良好的基准测试可以准确反映出应用程序在实际运行时的执行性能，
>
>本节所提到的一些基准测试套件，例如SPECjAppServer，同样可以作为通用基准测试应用于更大型的软件栈。

## 5.4.1 SPEC基准测试套件

[**SPEC（Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation）**][1]是一个非盈利性组织，其开发并维护着可用于对运行在现代硬件架构上的各类应用程序进行性能测试的多种基准测试套件。本节将对其中与Java相关的几种基准测试套件进行介绍。

除了本节中提到的几种SPEC基准测试套件和SPECjvm2008套件之外，其他的SPEC基准测试套件都是需要付费的。

### 5.4.1.1 SPECjvm基准测试套件

SPECjvm的第一个发行版是1998年的SPECjvm98，其设计初衷是测量JVM和JRE的执行性能，目前该版本已经下线。SPECjvm98是一个单线程的、绑定CPU的基准测试套件，它确实可以从某个侧面反映出JVM代码优化的质量，但也仅仅就这些了。几年之后，SPECjvm98就因其过小的工作对象集合（object working set）而再也无法承担起对现代JVM进行基准测试的任务了。SPECjvm98套件中包含了一些简单的测试用例，例如压缩、MP3解码，以及对javac编译器的性能测试等。

>译者注：猜测，这里的"object working sets"应该是指SPECjvm98的测试数据或工作负载。

SPECjvm目前的版本是SPECjvm2008，是SPECjvm98的改进版，在其基础上添加了一些新的基准测试用例，增大了工作负载，并且可应用于多核平台。此外，它还可以对JVM的一些内容指标进行测试，例如JVM启动时间和锁的执行性能。

近来，为了更好的进行测试，SPEC组织又在SPECjvm中添加了一些新的应用程序，例如对[Derby数据库][3]和加密框架的支持，此外，还对应用程序热身和在稳定状态下测试性能做了很多改进。

久负盛名的科学计算基准测试套件SciMark已被集成到SPECjvm2008中。在之前单独发行的SciMark套件中，由于并非所有JVM实现都支持OSR，所以不同JVM之间的测试结果不具可比性。这个问题在SPECjvm2008已经得以解决。

### 5.4.1.2 SPECjAppServer套件/SPECjEnterprise2010套件

SPECjAppServer是一个相当复杂的基准测试套件，安装也起来也很麻烦，但同时，它也是非常出色的。它的前身是ECPerf，经过SPECjAppServer2001、SPECjAppServer2002和SPECjAppServer2004这几个版本的发展，其最新版本已更名为SPECjEnterprise2010。

该基准测试套件的基本思想是尽可能多的软硬件平台上运行一个典型的J2EE应用程序，该J2EE应用程序会模拟汽车经销商与生产商之间的交互，以Web浏览器模拟经销商与生产商之间的对话，库存和交易数据保存在数据库中，生产过程用[RMI][5]操作来模拟。此外，SPECjEnterprise2010还在基准测试中引入了Web Service和其他一些Java EE 5.0版本中的功能。

SPECjAppServer套件不仅仅可用来对JVM进行基准测试，还可以对很多方面进行性能测试，例如服务器硬件、网络传输和某个具体的应用程序服务器等等，其会在给出测试分数时提供完整软硬件调用栈信息。就基准测试套件来说，SPECjAppServer/SPECjEnterprise2010非常出色，可以对系统的每一个部分进行性能测试，这对每个开发者来都是具有重要意义的。值得注意的是，基准测试的目标对象是J2EE应用程序的中间层，而不是数据库层或数据生成层。

该基准测试套件安装复杂（不过理论上只需要安装一次），难以调试，可以在单台机器上以自包含（self-contained）的形式运行，但这么干有点浪费资源，而且所得到的结果也不具说服力。

A typical setup requires a **System Under Test (SUT)**, consisting of network
infrastructure, application servers, and a database server, all residing on different
machines. A driver, external to the test system, injects load into the setup. This is
an example of the technique for measuring outside the system that was explained
earlier in this chapter. In SPECjEnterprise2010, one of the more fundamental changes,
compared to earlier versions, is that database load has been significantly reduced so
that other parts of the setup (the actual application on the application server) becomes
more relevant for performance.



In a complete setup, the performance of everything, from which network switch to
which RAID solution the disk uses, matters. For a JVM, SPECjAppServer is quite a
good benchmark. It covers a large Java code base and the execution profile is spread
out over many long stack traces with no particular "extra hot" methods. This places
strict demands on the JIT to do correct inlining. It can no longer look for just a few
bottleneck methods and optimize them.

![Figure 4-10][1]

As of SPECjAppServer2004, in order to successfully run the benchmark, a transaction
rate (TxRate) is used for work packet injection. This is increased as long as the
benchmark can keep up with the load, and as soon as the benchmark fails, the
maximum TxRate for the benchmark system can thus be determined. This is used
to compute the score.

The realism is much better in newer generations of the benchmark. Application
servers use more up-to-date standards and workloads have been increased to fit
modern architectures. Support for multiple application servers and multiple driver
machines has also been added. Measurements have also been changed to more
accurately reflect performance.

### 5.4.1.3 SPECjbb套件

SPECjbb is probably one of the most widespread Java benchmarks in use today.
It is interesting because it has been used frequently in academic research, and has
been a point of competition between the big three JVM providers, Oracle, IBM,
and Sun Microsystems. The big three, in cooperation with hardware vendors,
have taken turns publishing press releases announcing new world records.

SPECjbb has existed in two generations, SPECjbb2000 (retired), and lately
SPECjbb2005, that is still in use. SPECjbb, similar to SPECjAppServer, emulates
a transaction processing system in several tiers, but is run on one machine in a
self-contained application.

SPECjbb has done the Java world some good in that a lot of optimizations that
JVMs perform, especially code optimizations, have been driven by this benchmark,
producing beneficial spin-off effects. There are also many examples of real-life
applications that the quest for SPECjbb scores has contributed performance
to—for example, more efficient garbage collection and locks.

>Here are some examples of functionality and optimizations
in the JRockit JVM that are a direct result of trying to achieve
high scores on SPECjbb. There are many more. All of these
optimizations have produced measurable performance
increases for real-world applications, outside the benchmark:
* Lazy unlocking (biased locking)
* Better heuristics for object prefetching
* Support for large pages for code and heap
* Support for non-contiguous heaps
* Improvements to array handling such as System.
arraycopy implementations, clear-on-alloc
optimizations, and assignments to arrays
* Advanced escape analysis that runs only on parts
of methods

A downside of SPECjbb is that it is, in fact, quite hardware-dependent. SPECjbb is very
much memory bound, and just switching architectures to one with a larger L2 cache
will dramatically increase performance.

Another downside to SPECjbb is that it is possible to get away with only caring
about throughput performance. The best scores can be achieved if all execution is
occasionally stopped and then, massive amounts of parallel garbage collection is
allowed to take place for as long as it takes to clean the heap.

SPECjbb2005 has also been used as the basis for the SPECpower_ssj2008 benchmark
that utilizes the same transaction code, but with an externalized driver. It is used
to quantify transactions per Watt at different levels of load, to provide a basis for
measuring power consumption.

>Here's another benchmarking anecdote. Sometimes an optimization
designed for a benchmark is only that and has no real world applications.
An example from JRockit is calls to System.currentTimeMillis.
This is a Java method that goes to native and finds out what the system
time is, expressed in milliseconds since January 1, 1970. Because this
typically involves a system call or a privileged operation, very frequent
calls to System.currentTimeMillis could be a bottleneck on several
platforms.
>Irritatingly enough, it turned out that calls to System.
currentTimeMillis made up several percent of the total runtime of
SPECjbb2000. On some platforms, such as Windows and Solaris, quick
workarounds to obtain system time were available, but not on Linux.
On Linux, JRockit got around the bottleneck by using its own signal-
based OS timers instead. The Linux JVM uses a dedicated thread to catch
an OS-generated signal every 10 milliseconds. Each time the signal is
caught, a local time counter is increased. This makes timer granularity a
little worse than with the system timer. However, as long as the timer is
safe (that is, it cannot go backwards) this maintains Java semantics and
SPECjbb runs much faster.
>Today on JRockit versions for Linux, native-safe timers are disabled.
If you, for some weird reason, have problems with the performance of
System.currentTimeMillis in your application, they can still be
enabled with the hidden flag -XX:UseSafeTimer=true. We have
never heard of anyone who needs this.
