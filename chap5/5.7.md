# 5.7 常见性能瓶颈与规避方法

在之前几章中都有与常见陷阱和伪优化相关的内容，在做基准测试时，要规避这些问题，就需要对性能瓶颈和代码中出现的反模式有深入的理解。

>Care should be taken that any instrumentation is not too intrusive. If,
for example, the chosen instrumentation tool inserts extra bytecode
operations all over the application code, the overall timing of the
program can change completely. This may make the resulting profile
useless for drawing any kinds of conclusions about the original program
behavior. While small bytecode instrumenters may be handy for things
like implementing counters for specific kinds of events, they rarely
produce a true execution profile. Bytecode instrumenters also make it
necessary to recompile and restart the application. The JRockit Mission
Control suite, on the other hand, can plug in at runtime and profiles the
application with virtually no extra overhead.
>值得注意的是，

A benchmark or instrumentation result can provide great insights into why
an application contains performance bottlenecks. Over the years, the authors of
this book have examined many applications to determine why they aren't running
as fast as they should. Some findings keep recurring, and the following section
provides information on several common areas that cause performance problems and
what practices should be avoided or used with caution when programming Java.
