As described in the chapter on memory management, the Java runtime provides
a simplified memory model for the programmer. The developer does not need to
reserve memory from the operating system for storing data, nor does he need
to worry about returning the memory once the data is no longer in use.

Working with a garbage collected language could easily lead to the hasty conclusion
that resource management is a thing of the past, and that memory leaks are impossible.
Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, memory leaks are so common in Java
production systems that many IT departments have surrendered. Recurring scheduled
restarts of Java production systems are now all too common.

In this chapter, you will learn:
•  What we mean by a Java memory leak
•  How to detect a memory leak
•  How to find the cause of a memory leak using the JRockit Memory
